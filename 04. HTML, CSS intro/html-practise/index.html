    <h4>What to know on Election Night</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Former President <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" target="_blank">Donald
                Trump</a> spoke
            to supporters after he secured his third battleground victory of the
            evening by clinching Pennsylvania, bringing him closer to a White House win. Other swing states, including
            Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, are too close to call.</li>

        <li>Vice President Kamala Harris takes California, New York and other traditionally Democratic states, but any
            path to victory narrows now that Trump has broken through Democrats' "blue wall."</li>
        <li>Republicans will control the Senate after they flipped some Democratic-held seats. The House is still up for
            grabs.</li>
        <li>Separately, Democrat Angela Alsobrooks became the first Black woman elected to represent Maryland in the
            Senate, while Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester will be Delaware's first Black female senator.</li>
        <li>Several governor's races are also being decided, in addition to a number of crucial ballot measures on
            issues like abortion and marijuana.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>The incumbent president, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, initially ran for re-election with Harris,[8] and
        they became the party's presumptive nominees, facing little opposition;[9] however, what was generally
        considered to be a poor presidential debate performance in June 2024 intensified concerns about his age and
        health, and led to calls within his party for him to leave the race.[10] Although initially adamant about
        remaining in the race, Biden withdrew on July 21, becoming the first eligible incumbent president to withdraw
        since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968.[11] Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris,[12] who was voted the party's
        nominee by the delegates on August 5, 2024. Harris selected Walz as her running mate.[13][14]</p>
